## Configuration Options

### Bot Configuration

Customize your Discord bot's appearance and behavior:

<Columns cols={2}>
  <Card title="Basic Settings" icon="settings">
    Set the bot name, avatar, and default channel for notifications.
    <CodeGroup tabs="JSON,Environment">
      ```json
      {
        "bot_name": "AetherFlow Bot",
        "avatar_url": "https://example.com/bot-avatar.png",
        "default_channel_id": "123456789012345678"
      }
      ```
      ```bash
      export DISCORD_BOT_NAME="AetherFlow Bot"
      export DISCORD_AVATAR_URL="https://example.com/bot-avatar.png"
      export DISCORD_DEFAULT_CHANNEL_ID="123456789012345678"
      ```
    </CodeGroup>
  </Card>
  <Card title="Advanced Settings" icon="cog">
    Configure message formatting, retry logic, and rate limiting.
    <Expandable title="Rate Limiting">
      Discord allows 5 messages per 5 seconds per channel. AetherFlow handles this automatically with queuing.
    </Expandable>
  </Card>
</Columns>

### Channel Management

Manage which channels your bot can access and post to:

| Permission Level | Description | Use Case |
|------------------|-------------|----------|
| Text Channels | Post to any text channel | Server announcements |
| Thread Channels | Create and post to threads | Organized discussions |
| Direct Messages | Send DMs to users | Personal notifications |

## Using Discord in Workflows

### Basic Message Posting

Reference Discord in your workflow prompts naturally:

```
When a new customer signs up, post a welcome message to #customer-success channel in Discord.
```

### Advanced Automation Examples

<CodeGroup tabs="JavaScript,Python">
  ```javascript
  // Post formatted message with embeds
  const message = {
    channelId: '123456789012345678',
    content: '🚨 System Alert',
    embeds: [
      {
        title: 'Alert: Database Connection Issues',
        description: 'Database connection issues detected',
        color: 0xFF0000,
        fields: [
          {
            name: 'Severity',
            value: 'High',
            inline: true
          },
          {
            name: 'Status',
            value: 'Investigating',
            inline: true
          }
        ],
        timestamp: new Date()
      }
    ]
  };

  await discord.sendMessage(message);
  ```

  ```python
  # Send file with workflow results
  from aetherflow import DiscordClient

  discord = DiscordClient()
  discord.upload_file(
      channel_id='123456789012345678',
      filename='weekly_summary.pdf',
      file=open('summary.pdf', 'rb'),
      content='Here\'s this week\'s summary report 📊'
  )
  ```
</CodeGroup>

### Event Triggers

Set up workflows that respond to Discord events:

- **Message Events**: Trigger on specific keywords or patterns
- **Server Events**: React to new members or role changes
- **Reaction Events**: Process emoji reactions
- **Mention Events**: Respond when the bot is mentioned

Example trigger prompt:
```
When someone mentions @AetherFlow in Discord with "urgent", create a high-priority ticket and notify the on-call engineer.
```

## Webhook Integration

For real-time Discord events, configure webhooks:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Enable Gateway Intents" icon="webhook">
    In your Discord application settings, go to "Bot" and enable required Gateway Intents like "Server Members" and "Message Content".
  </Step>
  <Step title="Subscribe to Events" icon="bell">
    Configure which events to listen for: message creates, reactions, member updates.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Set Webhook URL" icon="link">
    Use your AetherFlow webhook URL: `https://api.aetherflow.com/webhooks/discord`
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Monitoring and Analytics

Track your Discord integration performance:

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

<ExpandableGroup>
  <Expandable title="Authentication Failed">
    Verify your bot token is correct and has the required permissions. Regenerate the token if needed.
  </Expandable>
  <Expandable title="Messages Not Posting">
    Check channel permissions and ensure the bot has access to the target channel.
  </Expandable>
  <Expandable title="Rate Limiting">
    Implement message queuing in your workflow. Discord allows 5 messages per 5 seconds per channel.
  </Expandable>
  <Expandable title="Webhook Events Not Received">
    Confirm Gateway Intents are enabled and the bot has proper permissions in your Discord server.
  </Expandable>
</ExpandableGroup>

### Debug Commands

```bash
# Test connection
aetherflow integrations test discord

# View logs
aetherflow logs --integration discord --last 24h

# Reset integration
aetherflow integrations reset discord
```

## Security Considerations

<Callout kind="alert">
  Store Discord tokens securely and rotate them regularly. Use the minimum required permissions for your use case.
</Callout>

- **Token Management**: AetherFlow encrypts all integration tokens
- **Permission Limitation**: Only grant necessary bot permissions
- **Audit Logging**: All Discord interactions are logged for compliance
- **Access Control**: Integration access follows your workspace permissions

## Best Practices

1. **Channel Organization**: Use dedicated channels for different types of notifications
2. **Message Formatting**: Use Discord embeds for rich, interactive messages
3. **Error Handling**: Implement fallback channels for critical notifications
4. **Testing**: Always test integrations in a development server first
5. **Monitoring**: Set up alerts for integration failures

<Callout kind="success">
  The Discord integration transforms AetherFlow into your server's communication hub, ensuring everyone stays informed about automated processes.
