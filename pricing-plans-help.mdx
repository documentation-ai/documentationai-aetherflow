## Understanding Executions

An execution is counted each time a workflow runs. Here's how it works:

### What Counts as an Execution?

- **Email processing**: If your workflow processes 10 emails, that's 10 executions
- **Scheduled workflows**: Daily workflows count as 1 execution per day
- **Manual runs**: Clicking to run a workflow manually counts as 1 execution
- **API triggers**: Each API call that triggers a workflow counts as 1 execution

### Monthly Limits by Plan

**Free Plan**: 1,000 executions/month<br/>
**Pro Plan**: 50,000 executions/month<br/>
**Enterprise Plan**: Unlimited executions
