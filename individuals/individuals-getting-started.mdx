<Callout kind="info">

This guide focuses on a simple, end-to-end setup. For more patterns and advanced options, check the dedicated [Individuals workflows](/individuals-workflows) and [Individuals integrations](/individuals-integrations) pages.

</Callout>

## Prerequisites

Before you start, make sure you have:

- A verified Individuals account
- Access to at least one tool you want to connect (for example, a notes app, todo app, or calendar)
- A recent browser (Chrome, Edge, Safari, or Firefox)

If you have issues signing up or logging in, see the Individuals section in the general [help center](/help-center).

## Step 1: Sign in and review your workspace

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open the Individuals app" icon="play-circle">

  1. Navigate to the Individuals sign-in page.
  2. Log in with the same email you used when you registered.
  3. If prompted, complete any multi-factor or email verification.

  </Step>
  <Step title="Check your profile and time zone" icon="settings">

  - Open your profile or settings menu.
  - Confirm your name, email, and time zone are correct.
  - Optionally enable error notifications so you are alerted when a workflow fails.

  </Step>
</Steps>

<Callout kind="tip">

If you plan to run time-based workflows (for example, every morning at 9:00), make sure your time zone is set correctly before you continue.

</Callout>

## Step 2: Create your first workflow

You will now create a basic workflow that runs on a simple trigger and performs one or two actions.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Start a new workflow" icon="plus">

  1. From the main navigation, go to the **Workflows** section.
  2. Select **Create workflow**.
  3. Give your workflow a clear name, for example `Daily summary` or `Capture ideas`.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Choose a trigger" icon="zap">

  Common starter triggers include:

  - **On schedule** (for example, every day at a specific time)
  - **On new item** in a connected app (for example, new note or task)
  - **On manual run** (you start it yourself when needed)

  Select a trigger, then set any required options such as frequency, folders, or filters.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Add one or more actions" icon="code">

  1. Click **Add step** or **Add action**.
  2. Choose a simple action, for example:
     - Create a note or task
     - Append text to a daily log
     - Send yourself a summary via email or chat
  3. Configure the fields with fixed text or values from the trigger, such as title, content, or labels.

  </Step>
</Steps>

To explore additional building blocks, see [Individuals workflows](/individuals-workflows).

## Step 3: Connect an integration

Most workflows rely on one or more integrations to read or write data to your tools.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open the integrations catalog" icon="folder">

  - Go to the **Integrations** section from the main navigation.
  - Browse or search for the app you want to connect.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Authorize the integration" icon="lock">

  1. Select the integration you want, then choose **Connect** or **Enable**.
  2. When redirected, sign in to the external app if needed.
  3. Review the permissions requested and approve if they look correct.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Return to your workflow and link the integration" icon="arrow-right">

  - Reopen your workflow from the **Workflows** list.
  - For each step that uses an external app, select the newly connected integration.
  - If required, pick a specific workspace, project, or folder inside that app.

  </Step>
</Steps>

You can find more details about each supported app on [Individuals integrations](/individuals-integrations).

## Step 4: Run and test your workflow

Before relying on a workflow, run a simple test to confirm that triggers and actions behave as expected.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Save and validate" icon="check-circle">

  - Make sure all required fields in each step are filled in.
  - Click **Save** or **Publish**.
  - Resolve any validation messages before continuing.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Trigger a test run" icon="play-circle">

  There are two common ways to test:

  - **Manual test**:
    - Use a **Run now** or **Test** button from the workflow editor.
    - Provide any required test inputs when prompted.
  - **Real trigger**:
    - Perform the action that should trigger the workflow (for example, create a new note or task).
    - Wait for the workflow to run based on your trigger conditions.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Check the run history and results" icon="bar-chart">

  1. Open the **Run history** for your workflow.
  2. Confirm that the test run appears with a `Success` status.
  3. Verify the expected changes in your connected app (for example, new note, updated task, or message).

  </Step>
</Steps>

If the workflow did not run or produced unexpected results, continue to the troubleshooting section.

## Troubleshooting quick guide

<ExpandableGroup>
  <Expandable title="My workflow is not triggering" default-open="true">

  - Confirm the workflow is **enabled** or **active**.
  - Make sure the trigger conditions match your test (for example, correct folder, project, or time).
  - Check that the integration used by the trigger is connected and not revoked.

  For more in-depth help, see [Individuals workflows](/individuals-workflows) and the general [troubleshooting guide](/troubleshooting).

  </Expandable>

  <Expandable title="The integration connection fails or expires">

  - Reopen the relevant item on [Individuals integrations](/individuals-integrations).
  - Click **Reconnect** and complete the authorization flow again.
  - If your external app has team or workspace permissions, confirm you have rights to install apps.

  If the issue persists across multiple attempts, contact support using the help options from the app.

  </Expandable>

  <Expandable title="The workflow runs but the output is not what I expect">

  - Review each step in the editor and confirm fields are mapped correctly.
  - Use the run history to inspect inputs and outputs for each step.
  - Simplify the workflow by disabling optional steps, then re-test.

  When you know the pattern you want to implement, the [Individuals workflows](/individuals-workflows) page has more examples and design tips.
