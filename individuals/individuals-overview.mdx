## What is Individuals?

Individuals is the personal edition of the platform, designed for individual contributors who want to automate their own work without managing teams, permissions, or complex org settings.

You get a focused workspace where you can experiment, build workflows for your day-to-day tasks, and connect the tools you already use.

This page is a high-level overview. If you want to start building right away, go to [Getting started for Individuals](/individuals-getting-started).

## What you can do

With Individuals, you can:

- Automate repetitive tasks across your apps without writing code.
- Create personal workflows that trigger on events, schedules, or manual runs.
- Connect popular tools you already use for communication, storage, and project tracking.
- Test ideas quickly before rolling them out to a team or company plan later.
- Keep your automations private and scoped to your own accounts.

### Common examples

A few typical ways individual contributors use the product:

- Automatically save important messages or attachments from chat into a notes or storage app.
- Get daily digests of updates from multiple tools in a single place.
- Turn form submissions or messages into tasks with consistent structure.
- Run one-off utilities (for example, bulk renaming, cleanups, or reports) from a single dashboard.

## Key concepts

Understanding these core concepts will help you read the rest of the Individuals docs and build confidently.

### Personal workspace

Your Individuals account gives you a single personal workspace:

- All workflows, connections, and settings live under your own user.
- You do not manage members, roles, or shared resources.
- Upgrades, billing, and limits apply only to your usage.

This keeps the product simple and predictable for solo use.

### Workflows

Workflows are the building blocks of automation:

- Each workflow defines **when** it runs (triggers) and **what** it does (steps).
- You can enable or disable workflows at any time.
- You can run some workflows manually when you need them, even if they also have triggers.

For a deeper look at how workflows function and how to design them, see [Individuals workflows](/individuals-workflows).

### Integrations and connections

Integrations let your workflows talk to external tools:

- Each integration represents a product or service (for example, a chat app or storage provider).
- You authenticate your own accounts to create **connections** that only you can use.
- Connections are reusable across multiple workflows in your Individuals workspace.

Learn what you can connect and how to manage those connections in [Individuals integrations](/individuals-integrations).

### Limits and boundaries

Compared to team or enterprise plans, Individuals focuses on:

- Simpler setup and fewer configuration steps.
- Personal scopes instead of organization-wide access.
- A streamlined feature set targeted at individual productivity.

If you later move to a team-based plan, your workflows and integrations can usually be adapted or migrated into a shared environment.

## When to use Individuals

Individuals is usually the right choice if:

- You are experimenting with automation for your own work.
- You do not need shared workspaces, approvals, or advanced governance.
- You want to validate a few workflows before introducing them to a broader team.

If you already manage automation for multiple people or departments, the Teams product may be a better fit.
