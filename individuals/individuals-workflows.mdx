## Overview

Workflows for Individuals let you automate personal tasks and routines: from reacting to events in your favorite apps to running scheduled cleanups or notifications.

If you are new to Individuals, start with the [overview](/individuals-overview) and [getting started](/individuals-getting-started) guides, then return here to design your first production-ready workflow.

<Callout kind="info">

This page focuses on **how** to structure and operate workflows as an individual user. For connecting specific tools, see [Individuals integrations](/individuals-integrations). For common questions, see the [Individuals FAQ](/individuals-faq).

## Core workflow concepts

### Triggers

A **trigger** is what starts a workflow run. Typical trigger types:

- **Event triggers**: fire when something happens in a connected app (for example, new email received, task created).
- **Schedule triggers**: run at a defined time or interval (for example, every morning at 8:00).
- **Manual triggers**: start when you click a button or call an endpoint.

Good trigger design:

- Be **specific** (for example, "new starred email in Inbox" instead of "any new email").
- Filter as early as possible to avoid unnecessary runs.
- Prefer a **single, clear entry point** per workflow.

### Steps

A **step** is an action, transformation, or decision in your workflow. Common step types:

- **Actions**: send a message, create a task, update a record.
- **Logic**: conditionals (if/else), branching, and loops.
- **Utilities**: format text, parse dates, map fields between apps.

Tips for step design:

- Keep each step **single-purpose** (do one thing well).
- Name steps after their outcome (for example, "Create follow-up task" instead of "Step 3").
- Centralize reusable logic (for example, "Normalize contact data") instead of repeating it.

### Runs

A **run** is a single execution of a workflow from trigger to completion.

Each run should have:

- A unique identifier.
- A status (for example, `success`, `failed`, `canceled`).
- A timeline of executed steps and their outputs.

Use runs to:

- Debug behavior (what happened and why).
- Measure performance (how long it takes to complete).
- Monitor reliability (how often runs fail or are retried).

## Recommended workflow structure

### Keep one responsibility per workflow

Design workflows around a clear, user-facing outcome:

- "Turn important emails into tasks."
- "Summarize my calendar each morning."
- "Sync notes to a backup notebook."

Avoid workflows that:

- Mix unrelated responsibilities.
- Depend on many fragile conditions.
- Are hard to explain in one sentence.

### Suggested layout

A simple structure that works well for most Individuals workflows:

1. **Trigger & initial filters**
   - Receive the event or schedule.
   - Discard runs that clearly do not matter.

2. **Normalization & context**
   - Clean up text and dates.
   - Fetch any related data you need once and reuse it.

3. **Decision logic**
   - Branch on relevant conditions (importance, labels, source app).
   - Keep branching shallow and readable.

4. **Actions**
   - Perform the minimal set of external actions.
   - Group related updates when possible to reduce noise.

5. **Notifications & logging**
   - Optionally notify yourself when something important happens.
   - Store enough information to understand what the workflow did.

<Steps>

<Step title="Example structure: Inbox to task list" icon="git-branch">

1. Trigger on **new important email**.
2. Filter out newsletters and automated notifications.
3. Extract subject, sender, and due date hints from the email.
4. Decide priority based on sender and keywords.
5. Create a task in your task manager with parsed details.
6. Add a short log entry so you can later audit what was created.

</Step>

</Steps>

## Error handling and resilience

### Design for failure

Assume that:

- External apps can be temporarily unavailable.
- Individual steps can fail for a subset of inputs.
- Configuration (for example, credentials, channels) might change over time.

Common patterns for resilient workflows:

- Validate inputs early (for example, require a non-empty title before creating a task).
- Use safe defaults when optional data is missing.
- Guard integrations behind feature flags or conditionals when experimenting.

<Callout kind="tip">

When you add a new integration step, first protect it with a simple condition such as "only run when a specific label or tag is present" until you are confident it behaves as expected.

</Callout>

### Handling step failures

A practical approach for Individuals:

- **Fail fast** on critical steps that must succeed (for example, creating a calendar event).
- **Skip non-critical steps** when they fail (for example, optional notification) and continue the run.
- Add **clear error messages** to failed runs so you can quickly see what went wrong.

Examples of error handling strategies:

- Wrap fragile steps in conditionals (for example, "only send DM if chat handle is set").
- Provide fallback values (for example, use today as a due date if a date cannot be parsed).
- Use separate workflows for "happy path" and "exception handling" when things get complex.

## Testing workflows safely

### Use test inputs

Before you rely on a workflow for daily use:

1. Create or select test data in your connected apps.
2. Run the workflow **manually** with that input where available.
3. Inspect the run details after each change.

Focus on testing:

- Typical inputs that you expect most often.
- Edge cases (missing fields, very long text, unusual characters).
- Failure paths (for example, disconnected integrations).

### Use sandbox destinations when possible

Where your tools support it:

- Send outputs to a **test project, notebook, or calendar** first.
- Use a dedicated test channel or email address for notifications.
- Move to your real destination only after runs look consistently correct.

## Versioning personal workflows

Even as an individual user, treating workflows as versioned artifacts makes changes safer.

Recommended practices:

- Maintain a clear **version label** or note in the workflow description.
- When making risky changes, **duplicate** the workflow and experiment in the copy.
- Keep a short **change log** in the description (for example, "v2: added calendar step, v3: new filters for newsletters").

<Expandable title="When to create a new version" default-open="true">

Create a new workflow version instead of editing in place when:

- You are changing the trigger behavior.
- You are adding or removing major integrations.
- You cannot afford disruptions (for example, important reminders or backups).

Run the new version in parallel for a while, then disable the old one when you are confident it is stable.

</Expandable>

<Expandable title="When to edit in place" default-open="false">

It is usually safe to edit a workflow directly when:

- You are only updating labels, descriptions, or notification text.
- You are fixing an obvious bug with a very small change.
- You are adding extra logging without changing behavior.

Even for small edits, test with a manual run if the workflow is critical.

## Example workflow recipes

### Recipe 1: Turn starred emails into follow-up tasks

Use this when you star emails that need a response and want an up-to-date task list.

<Steps>

<Step title="Define the trigger" icon="zap">

- Trigger: new email in your inbox.
- Filter: only emails where you are the direct recipient.
- Additional filter: only when the email is **starred** or marked important.

</Step>

<Step title="Map email to task fields" icon="settings">

- Title: email subject.
- Description: short summary including sender and the first lines of the email.
- Due date: tomorrow for high-priority emails, two days later for others.
- Labels: add labels such as `email`, `follow-up`.

</Step>

<Step title="Create and confirm the task" icon="check-circle">

- Create a task in your chosen task manager.
- Optionally post a confirmation to a private chat or email so you can see what was created.
- Log the created task identifier on the run for quick debugging.

</Step>

</Steps>

### Recipe 2: Daily agenda summary

Get a daily digest of your upcoming day without opening your calendar and task apps.

<Steps>

<Step title="Schedule the trigger" icon="clock">

- Trigger: schedule at **7:00 local time** every weekday.
- Optional: add a condition to skip holidays if your calendar exposes them.

</Step>

<Step title="Collect events and tasks" icon="database">

- Fetch calendar events for the next 24 hours.
- Fetch tasks due today or overdue.
