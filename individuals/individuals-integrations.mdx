## What integrations are for Individuals

As an Individual, integrations (also called connections) let your account securely access data and actions in third‑party tools such as email, chat, storage, or project management apps.

When you connect an app:

- You approve access via the app&apos;s own sign‑in screen (typically OAuth).
- We receive a short‑lived authorization code and exchange it for tokens.
- Your workflows can then read or update data in that app according to the permissions you granted.

## Security and data access

Integrations for Individuals are designed around three principles:

- **Consent:** Nothing is connected unless you explicitly approve it.
- **Scoping:** Each integration is limited to the permissions you grant.
- **Revocation:** You can disconnect at any time, both from your account and from the third‑party app.

### What we can see and do

The exact data access depends on each app and the scopes you approve, but in general:

- We store encrypted access tokens so your workflows can call the app&apos;s API.
- We only read or modify data when a workflow you created runs and needs that data.
- We log integration usage so you can audit which workflows used which connection.

<Callout kind="tip">

For details on how data is stored and encrypted across the platform, see [Data privacy and compliance](/data-privacy-compliance).

</Callout>

## Connecting a new integration

You typically connect integrations from your Individuals settings or when configuring a workflow step that needs an app.

<Steps>

<Step title="Open your Individuals integrations" icon="settings">

- Sign in to your Individuals account.
- Go to **Settings** and open the **Integrations** or **Connections** tab.

</Step>

<Step title="Choose the app to connect" icon="plus">

- Click **Connect** next to the app you want to use.
- Review the short description of what the integration can do.

</Step>

<Step title="Approve access in the third‑party app" icon="lock">

- You are redirected to the app&apos;s sign‑in or consent screen.
- Sign in (if needed) and review the requested permissions.
- Click **Allow**, **Approve**, or the equivalent button to grant access.

</Step>

<Step title="Finish setup and test" icon="check-circle">

- You are redirected back to your Individuals account.
- The new connection appears as **Connected**.
- Optionally run a test workflow or a sample action to confirm everything works.

</Step>

</Steps>

### Connecting from a workflow

You can also connect an app while building a workflow:

1. Create or open a workflow in your Individuals workspace.
2. Add a step that uses the app (for example, &quot;Send email&quot; or &quot;Post to chat&quot;).
3. When prompted to choose a connection, click **New connection** and follow the same approval flow.

For an end‑to‑end example of using integrations inside automations, see [Individuals workflows](/individuals-workflows).

## Permission scopes and least privilege

Most apps support granular permission scopes, such as:

- Read‑only vs. read/write
- Access to a single calendar, channel, or project instead of your entire account
- Limited access to metadata (for example, message subjects only)

To follow least‑privilege best practices:

- **Grant the smallest scope that still lets your workflow succeed.**
- **Create separate connections** for different purposes (for example, a read‑only connection for analytics workflows, a write‑enabled one for notifications).
- **Avoid reusing personal connections** for testing in shared contexts; instead, keep a dedicated automation or service account where the app supports it.

<Callout kind="success">

You can update permissions at any time by disconnecting and reconnecting an app with different scopes.

</Callout>

## Disconnecting an integration

You can revoke access from either your Individuals account or directly in the third‑party app. For full revocation, do both.

<Steps>

<Step title="Disconnect from your Individuals account" icon="trash">

- Go to **Settings → Integrations**.
- Find the connected app.
- Click **Disconnect** or **Remove**.
- Confirm you understand existing workflows using this connection may fail until you reconnect.

</Step>

<Step title="Revoke access in the third‑party app" icon="shield">

- Open the third‑party app&apos;s security or connected apps settings.
- Locate the connection associated with your Individuals account.
- Revoke or remove access to ensure any remaining tokens are invalidated.

</Step>

</Steps>

After disconnecting, workflows that depended on that integration will return authentication errors until you reconnect or update them to use a different connection.

## Troubleshooting authentication issues

Authentication failures usually fall into a few categories.

<ExpandableGroup>

<Expandable title="Expired or revoked tokens" default-open="true">

Common symptoms:

- Workflows that used to work start failing with unauthorized errors.
- Logs mention &quot;token expired&quot; or &quot;invalid_grant&quot;.

How to fix:

1. Go to **Settings → Integrations**.
2. Click **Reconnect** (if available) or disconnect and connect the app again.
3. Re‑run the affected workflow.

</Expandable>

<Expandable title="Changed password or multi‑factor settings">

If you recently changed your password or security settings in the connected app, it may invalidate existing tokens.

To resolve:

1. Sign in to the third‑party app and confirm your account is active.
2. Reconnect the integration from your Individuals settings.
3. If the app requires additional verification, complete those steps during the consent flow.

</Expandable>

<Expandable title="Insufficient permissions or missing scopes">

If a workflow fails with errors like &quot;forbidden&quot; or &quot;missing_scope&quot;:

1. Review the specific action the workflow is trying to perform.
2. Disconnect the integration.
3. Reconnect the app, carefully granting the scopes required for that action.
4. Re‑run the workflow to confirm.

</Expandable>

<Expandable title="App‑side restrictions or admin policies">

Some apps restrict third‑party access based on organization or admin policy. If you see messages about blocked access or disallowed apps:

1. Check whether your account is allowed to install third‑party apps.
2. If you are using a work account, contact your admin.
3. Consider connecting with a different account that permits automations, if appropriate.

## Best practices for Individuals integrations

Use these guidelines to keep your personal automations safe and manageable:

- **Prefer least privilege:** Always choose the narrowest reasonable scopes.
- **Review connections regularly:** Periodically remove integrations you no longer use.
- **Separate testing from production:** Use a dedicated test integration for experiments so you do not accidentally affect important data.
- **Audit workflows after changes:** If you change or disconnect a connection, review the workflows that used it.
- **Avoid sharing credentials:** Do not share connected accounts or tokens. If someone needs access, share the workflow logic, not your login.
