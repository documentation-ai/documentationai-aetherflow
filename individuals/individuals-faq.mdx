<Expandable title="What is Individuals and who is it for?" default-open="true">

Individuals is the single-user version of our platform. It gives you the same core automation engine as Teams, but optimized for:

- Personal productivity and experimentation
- Solo founders, freelancers, and consultants
- Users who want to try workflows before rolling them out to a team

You can build, run, and monitor your own workflows end to end. For an architecture and feature tour, see the [Individuals overview](/individuals-overview).

</Expandable>

<Expandable title="What are the main limits for Individuals?">

Typical limits for Individuals include:

- Maximum number of active workflows
- Monthly run or task quotas
- Rate limits on triggers and integrations
- Retention windows for logs and run history

Exact limits depend on your current plan. You can usually see them in your account or billing settings.

If you are consistently hitting limits or planning a larger rollout, consider upgrading to Teams. The [Individuals workflows guide](/individuals-workflows) shows how to design workflows that scale.

</Expandable>

<Expandable title="How is Individuals priced?">

Individuals uses a simple subscription model with usage-based limits. In most cases you pay:

- A base monthly fee for access to the platform
- Optional add-ons or higher tiers for additional runs or advanced features

For the most current details, check the pricing section in your account or on the main pricing page.

</Expandable>

<Expandable title="How does privacy and security work for Individuals?">

Your data is scoped to your personal account. Typical protections include:

- Encrypted storage for credentials and secrets
- Secure connections to external integrations
- Access controls that prevent other users from seeing your workflows or runs

If you have stricter requirements (for example, audit logs, SSO, data residency), those are usually available on Teams or enterprise plans. For a deeper overview of platform guarantees, see the general data privacy and security documentation in the main product.

</Expandable>

<Expandable title="Can I migrate from Individuals to Teams later?">

Yes. You can generally upgrade from Individuals to Teams without losing your work. A typical migration includes:

- Converting your personal account into a team workspace
- Transferring existing workflows into shared projects
- Updating ownership, permissions, and integrations as needed

For guidance on planning a rollout, see the Teams [Migration guide](/migration-guide). For Individuals-specific questions, contact support and mention that you are migrating from an Individuals account.

</Expandable>

<Expandable title="What integrations are supported for Individuals?">

Individuals supports the same core integrations as Teams, including common SaaS apps, communication tools, and databases.

Some team-only or enterprise-only integrations may require a Teams upgrade. To see how to connect and use integrations, read:

- [Individuals integrations](/individuals-integrations)
- The general [Integrations guide](/integrations)

1. Sign in to your Individuals account.
2. Create a new workflow and choose a trigger.
3. Add one or more actions and map fields.
4. Test the workflow with sample data.

- Confirm the workflow is turned on and saved.
