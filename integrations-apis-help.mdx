## Custom API Integrations

Can't find your favorite tool in our integration directory? No problem - AetherFlow supports custom API connections:

### REST API Integration

Connect to any REST API using built-in HTTP request actions:

- **GET requests**: Retrieve data from external APIs
- **POST/PUT requests**: Send data to web services
- **Authentication**: Support for API keys, OAuth, and custom headers
- **Data transformation**: Parse JSON, XML, and other response formats

### Webhook Integration

Use webhooks for real-time, event-driven automation:

- **Incoming webhooks**: Trigger workflows when external services send data
- **Outgoing webhooks**: Send data to your applications in real-time
- **Custom endpoints**: Define your own webhook URLs for maximum flexibility
- **Security**: Built-in signature verification and authentication

### Custom Connectors (Enterprise)

For complex enterprise systems, we offer custom connector development:

- **Proprietary APIs**: Connect to internal or custom-built systems
- **Legacy systems**: Integrate with older enterprise software
- **Multi-step authentication**: Support for complex auth flows and custom security requirements
- **Performance optimization**: Custom-built connectors optimized for high-volume data processing

## Integration Best Practices

### Security Considerations

**Security Best Practices**

- Use the principle of least privilege when granting API permissions
- Regularly rotate API keys and access tokens
- Monitor integration usage and set up alerts for unusual activity
- Use encrypted connections (HTTPS/TLS) for all API communications

### Performance Optimization

- **Batch operations**: Group multiple API calls when possible
- **Caching**: Store frequently accessed data to reduce API calls
- **Rate limiting awareness**: Respect API limits to avoid service disruptions
- **Error handling**: Implement retry logic and fallback mechanisms

### Monitoring & Maintenance

- **Health checks**: Regularly test integration connections
- **Usage monitoring**: Track API call volumes and performance metrics
- **Version management**: Stay updated with API changes and deprecations
- **Documentation**: Maintain clear records of integration configurations

## Common Integration Scenarios

### E-commerce Automation

**Order Processing**<br/>
Automatically process new orders: update inventory, send confirmations, and trigger fulfillment workflows.

**Customer Notifications**<br/>
Send personalized order updates via email, SMS, or chat based on order status changes.

### Marketing Automation

**Lead Nurturing**<br/>
Automatically score leads, send follow-up emails, and create tasks for sales teams.

**Social Media Management**<br/>
Schedule posts, monitor mentions, and engage with your audience across multiple platforms.

### IT Operations

**Incident Response**<br/>
Automatically create tickets, notify teams, and escalate critical system alerts.

**Monitoring & Alerting**<br/>
Aggregate logs, set up custom alerts, and automate remediation workflows.

## API Reference & Documentation

### Authentication Methods

AetherFlow supports multiple authentication methods for API integrations:

- **OAuth 2.0**: Industry standard for secure API access
- **API Keys**: Simple token-based authentication
- **Basic Auth**: Username/password for legacy systems
- **Bearer Tokens**: JWT and custom token formats
- **Custom Headers**: Flexible authentication for proprietary APIs

### Rate Limiting

Understanding and managing API rate limits:

- **Request throttling**: Automatic queuing of API calls
- **Intelligent retry**: Exponential backoff for rate-limited requests
- **Usage monitoring**: Real-time tracking of API consumption
- **Quota management**: Alerts when approaching rate limits

### Error Handling

Robust error handling for reliable integrations:

- **HTTP status codes**: Proper handling of 4xx and 5xx responses
- **Timeout management**: Configurable timeouts for long-running requests
- **Retry logic**: Automatic retries with configurable strategies
- **Fallback options**: Alternative actions when primary integrations fail

## Enterprise Integration Features
