## Creating Your First Workflow

Getting started with workflow automation is simple with AetherFlow's AI-powered approach:

### Step-by-Step Guide

<Steps>
  <Step title="Log in to your dashboard">
    Access your AetherFlow dashboard
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create new workflow">
    Click "Create Workflow" or "New Workflow" button
  </Step>
  <Step title="Describe your automation">
    Write in plain English, for example:
    - "When I receive an email from a customer, summarize it and post the summary to our Slack channel"
    - "Every morning at 9 AM, check my calendar and send a daily briefing to my team"
    - "When a new lead is added to HubSpot, create a task in Asana and schedule a follow-up email"
  </Step>
  <Step title="Review generated workflow">
    AetherFlow's AI will create the steps automatically
  </Step>
  <Step title="Test the workflow">
    Ensure it works as expected

## Workflow Triggers

AetherFlow workflows can run automatically based on various triggers:

### Event-Based Triggers
- **Email received**: Gmail, Outlook, or any email service
- **Form submissions**: Web forms, surveys, or contact forms
- **New records**: CRM entries, database records, or API calls
- **Social media**: New mentions, posts, or messages
- **File uploads**: When files are added to cloud storage

### Time-Based Triggers
- **Scheduled**: Run at specific times (daily at 9 AM, weekly on Mondays)
- **Recurring**: Every X hours, days, or weeks
- **Conditional**: Based on dates or calendar events

### Manual & API Triggers
- **Button clicks**: Manual execution from dashboard
- **API calls**: Triggered by external systems
- **Webhooks**: Real-time notifications from connected services

## Editing and Managing Workflows

### Modifying Existing Workflows

You can edit workflows at any time to adapt to changing needs:

#### Natural Language Editing
- **Update prompts**: Modify the original English description
- **AI regeneration**: Let AetherFlow recreate the workflow steps
- **Add context**: Provide more details for complex automations

#### Manual Step Editing
- **Add steps**: Insert new actions into your workflow
- **Remove steps**: Delete unnecessary or problematic steps
- **Reorder steps**: Change the sequence of operations
- **Modify settings**: Update integration credentials or parameters

#### Advanced Options
- **Conditional logic**: Add if-then-else branching
- **Error handling**: Define custom responses to failures
- **Data mapping**: Transform data between steps
- **Variables**: Store and reuse values across steps

### Workflow States

**Workflow Status Management**

- **Active** - Running automatically
- **Paused** - Temporarily disabled
- **Error** - Needs attention

## Workflow Performance Monitoring

### Analytics Dashboard

Monitor your workflow performance with comprehensive analytics:

#### Key Metrics
- **Success Rate**: Percentage of successful executions
- **Average Runtime**: How long workflows take to complete
- **Execution Frequency**: How often workflows run
- **Error Patterns**: Common failure points and causes

#### Performance Insights
- **Bottlenecks**: Identify slow steps in your workflows
- **Resource Usage**: Monitor API calls and processing time
- **Cost Analysis**: Track execution usage against your plan limits
- **Trend Analysis**: See performance changes over time

### Setting Up Alerts

Configure notifications for important events:
- **Performance degradation**: When workflows run slower than expected
- **High error rates**: When failure rates exceed thresholds
- **Plan limit warnings**: When approaching execution limits
- **Integration issues**: When connected services have problems

## Best Practices for Workflow Design

### Optimization Tips

**Start with Clear Descriptions**<br/>
Be specific in your natural language prompts. Include details about triggers, conditions, and expected outcomes.

**Test Thoroughly**<br/>
Always test workflows with real data before activating them in production environments.

**Monitor Regularly**<br/>
Set up dashboards and alerts to catch issues early and optimize performance.

**Keep It Simple**<br/>
Break complex processes into smaller, focused workflows rather than one massive automation.

### Common Workflow Patterns

- **Data Synchronization**: Keep information consistent across multiple systems
- **Notification Systems**: Alert teams about important events or changes
- **Data Processing**: Transform, filter, or enrich data as it flows through systems
- **Approval Workflows**: Route requests for review and approval
- **Reporting Automation**: Generate and distribute regular reports

## Troubleshooting Workflows

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### Workflow Not Triggering
- **Check status**: Ensure the workflow is active, not paused
- **Verify triggers**: Confirm trigger conditions are correctly configured
- **Integration permissions**: Ensure AetherFlow has access to triggering services
- **Service status**: Check if connected services are operational

#### Workflow Failures
- **Review logs**: Check execution logs for specific error messages
- **Integration issues**: Verify API keys and permissions
- **Data format problems**: Ensure data structure matches expectations
- **Rate limiting**: Check for API rate limit violations

#### Performance Issues
- **Optimize steps**: Remove unnecessary operations
- **Parallel processing**: Use concurrent execution where possible
- **Caching**: Implement data caching for frequently accessed information
- **Monitoring**: Set up performance monitoring and alerts
