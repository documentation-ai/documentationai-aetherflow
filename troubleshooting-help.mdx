# Troubleshooting Guide

Having trouble with your AetherFlow workflows? This comprehensive troubleshooting guide will help you identify and resolve common issues. Follow the step-by-step solutions below to get your automations running smoothly.

## Quick Issue Diagnosis

### Workflow Not Triggering

**Common Causes & Solutions**

**Workflow Status**<br/>
Check if your workflow is active or paused.<br/>
**Solution:** Go to your workflow dashboard and ensure the status shows "Active" (green indicator). If paused, click the play button to activate it.

**Trigger Conditions**<br/>
Verify your trigger settings are correct.<br/>
**Solution:** Review trigger conditions (e.g., email sender, keywords, time schedules). Test manually to ensure conditions are met.

**Integration Permissions**<br/>
Ensure AetherFlow has proper access to connected services.<br/>
**Solution:** Re-authorize integrations in Settings → Integrations. Check for expired tokens or revoked permissions.

**Service Availability**<br/>
Verify connected services are operational.<br/>
**Solution:** Check service status pages (e.g., Gmail status, Slack status) and our status page at status.aetherflow.com.

### Workflow Execution Failures

**Common Failure Scenarios**

**Integration API Issues**<br/>
Rate limits, API outages, or authentication problems<br/>
**Check:** API status, rate limits, authentication tokens

**Data Format Problems**<br/>
Unexpected data structure from integrations<br/>
**Check:** Data mapping, field formats, required fields

**Permission Changes**<br/>
Revoked access to connected accounts<br/>
**Check:** Account permissions, OAuth tokens, service access

**Rate Limiting**<br/>
Too many API calls in a short period<br/>
**Check:** API quotas, request frequency, batch operations

## Step-by-Step Troubleshooting Process

### 1. Check Workflow Logs

**Accessing Execution Logs**

1. Navigate to your workflow in the dashboard
2. Click on the "Logs" or "History" tab
3. Look for recent executions and their status
4. Click on failed executions to see detailed error messages
5. Check timestamps to understand when failures occurred
6. Review input data and step-by-step execution details

**Pro Tip:** Enable detailed logging in workflow settings to get more comprehensive error information.

### 2. Test Workflow Manually

**For Trigger-Based Workflows:**
- Use the "Test" button in workflow settings
- Provide sample input data that matches your trigger
- Verify each step executes correctly
- Check output data and integration responses

**For Scheduled Workflows:**
- Temporarily change schedule to run immediately
- Execute manually using the run button
- Monitor execution in real-time
- Restore original schedule after testing

### 3. Verify Integration Health

**Integration Health Checks**

**Re-authorize Connections**<br/>
Go to Settings → Integrations and click "Reconnect" for problematic services.

**Check API Limits**<br/>
Review your API usage in integration dashboards and ensure you haven't exceeded limits.

**Verify Credentials**<br/>
Ensure API keys, tokens, and passwords are current and have proper permissions.

## Performance Monitoring

### Setting Up Performance Alerts

Configure notifications for workflow performance issues:

- **Execution failures**: Get alerted when workflows fail repeatedly
- **Slow performance**: Notifications when workflows take longer than expected
- **Resource usage**: Alerts when approaching plan limits
- **Integration issues**: Automatic detection of connection problems

### Performance Optimization

**Analytics Dashboard**<br/>
Monitor workflow performance metrics<br/>
• Success rates and failure patterns<br/>
• Average execution times<br/>
• Resource usage and API calls<br/>
• Error frequency and types

**Optimization Strategies**<br/>
Improve workflow efficiency<br/>
• Batch operations where possible<br/>
• Implement caching for repeated data<br/>
• Use parallel processing<br/>
• Optimize data transformations

## Advanced Troubleshooting

### Common Error Messages

**Error Code Reference**

**AUTHENTICATION_FAILED**<br/>
Integration credentials are invalid or expired. Re-authorize the connection.

**RATE_LIMIT_EXCEEDED**<br/>
Too many API calls. Implement delays or upgrade your plan for higher limits.

**DATA_FORMAT_ERROR**<br/>
Input data doesn't match expected format. Check data mapping and field types.

**SERVICE_UNAVAILABLE**<br/>
External service is down. Check service status and retry later.

### Debug Mode

Enable advanced debugging for complex issues:

- **Step-by-step execution**: See exactly what happens at each workflow step
- **Variable inspection**: Check the values of variables throughout execution
- **API request/response logging**: View all HTTP requests and responses
- **Conditional breakpoints**: Pause execution at specific points for inspection
