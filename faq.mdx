## Getting Started

Common questions for new users getting started with AetherFlow.

<Expandable title="What is AetherFlow?">
AetherFlow is an AI-powered workflow automation platform that allows you to create automations using natural language. Instead of writing complex code or using drag-and-drop interfaces, you simply describe what you want to automate in plain English, and our AI engine handles the rest.

For example, you can say "When I receive an email from a customer, summarize it and post the summary to our Slack channel" and AetherFlow will create and execute that workflow automatically.
</Expandable>

<Expandable title="How do I sign up for AetherFlow?">
Visit [aetherflow.com](https://aetherflow.com) and click the "Sign Up" button. You can create an account using your email address or sign up with Google, Microsoft, or other OAuth providers. There's a 14-day free trial available with no credit card required to get started.
</Expandable>

<Expandable title="What integrations does AetherFlow support?">
AetherFlow supports over 50 popular business applications, including:

**Communication**: Slack, Microsoft Teams, Gmail, Outlook
**Productivity**: Notion, Google Workspace, Trello, Asana
**CRM**: Salesforce, HubSpot, Zendesk, Intercom
**Development**: GitHub, Jira, Linear
**And many more...**

If you don't see your favorite app, you can use webhooks or custom API integrations to connect virtually any service.
</Expandable>

<Expandable title="Is AetherFlow secure?">
Yes, security is our top priority. AetherFlow uses bank-level encryption (AES-256) for data at rest and TLS 1.3 for data in transit. We are SOC 2 Type II compliant, GDPR compliant, and offer enterprise-grade security features including SSO, audit logging, and customer-managed encryption keys.

## Pricing and Plans

Questions about AetherFlow's pricing structure and plans.

<Expandable title="How much does AetherFlow cost?">
AetherFlow offers three main plans:

- **Free**: 5 workflows, 1,000 executions/month, 3 integrations
- **Pro**: $29/user/month (annual) or $39 (monthly), unlimited workflows, 50,000 executions/month, 25+ integrations
- **Enterprise**: Custom pricing for large organizations with advanced features

All plans include a 14-day free trial. Enterprise plans start at $99/user/month with custom terms available.
</Expandable>

<Expandable title="Can I change plans later?">
Yes, you can upgrade or downgrade your plan at any time. Upgrades take effect immediately, while downgrades take effect at the start of your next billing cycle. Your data and workflows are preserved during plan changes.
</Expandable>

<Expandable title="What counts as a workflow execution?">
An execution is counted each time a workflow runs. For example:
- If your workflow triggers on new emails and processes 10 emails, that's 10 executions
- Scheduled workflows that run daily count as 1 execution per day
- Manual workflow runs also count toward your monthly limit

The Free plan gives you 1,000 executions/month, Pro gives 50,000, and Enterprise has unlimited executions.
</Expandable>

<Expandable title="Do you offer discounts for non-profits or educational institutions?">
Yes! We offer 50% discounts for verified non-profit organizations and accredited educational institutions. Contact our sales team at sales@aetherflow.com with documentation to apply.

## Workflows and Automation

Technical questions about creating and managing workflows.

<Expandable title="How do I create my first workflow?">
1. Log into your AetherFlow dashboard
2. Click "Create Workflow" or "New Workflow"
3. Write a clear, specific description in plain English (e.g., "When I get a new lead in HubSpot, create a task in Asana and send a notification to Slack")
4. AetherFlow's AI will generate the workflow steps
5. Review and test the workflow
6. Activate it to start automating

Check out our [Getting Started guide](/getting-started) for detailed instructions.
</Expandable>

<Expandable title="Can workflows run automatically?">
Yes! Workflows can be triggered in several ways:
- **Event-based**: When something happens (new email, form submission, etc.)
- **Schedule-based**: At specific times or intervals (daily at 9 AM, every Monday, etc.)
- **Manual**: When you click a button to run them
- **API/Webhook**: Triggered by external systems or API calls

Most workflows are designed to run automatically once set up.
</Expandable>

<Expandable title="How reliable are AetherFlow workflows?">
AetherFlow is designed for reliability with:
- 99.5% uptime SLA (99.9% for Enterprise)
- Automatic retry logic for failed steps
- Error handling and fallback options
- Real-time monitoring and alerting
- Comprehensive logging for troubleshooting

However, reliability also depends on the integrations you use - if a connected service is down, it may affect your workflow execution.
</Expandable>

<Expandable title="Can I edit workflows after creating them?">
Yes, you can modify workflows at any time:
- Edit the natural language prompt to change behavior
- Add or remove steps manually
- Modify integration settings
- Update triggers and schedules
- Enable/disable workflows

Changes take effect immediately for new executions.
</Expandable>

2. Search for the app you want to connect
3. Click "Connect" and follow the OAuth authorization flow

5. Test the connection

Most integrations take less than 2 minutes to set up. Check our [Integrations guide](/integrations) for detailed instructions for each service.

## Troubleshooting

Common issues and how to resolve them.

<Expandable title="My workflow isn't triggering. What should I check?">
1. **Status**: Make sure the workflow is enabled (not paused)
2. **Triggers**: Verify your trigger conditions are correct
3. **Permissions**: Ensure AetherFlow has access to the triggering service
4. **Integration Health**: Check if the connected services are operational
5. **Logs**: Review the workflow execution logs for error messages

You can test workflows manually to isolate issues.
</Expandable>

<Expandable title="Why did my workflow fail?">
Common reasons for workflow failures:
- **Integration Issues**: Connected service API limits or outages
- **Data Format Problems**: Unexpected data structure from integrations
- **Permission Changes**: Revoked access to connected accounts
- **Rate Limiting**: Too many API calls in a short period
- **Prompt Ambiguity**: Unclear natural language instructions

Check the workflow logs for specific error messages and our [Troubleshooting guide](/troubleshooting) for solutions.
</Expandable>

<Expandable title="How do I monitor workflow performance?">
Use the Analytics dashboard to monitor:
- **Execution Success Rate**: Percentage of successful runs
- **Average Runtime**: How long workflows take to complete
- **Error Frequency**: Common failure points
- **Resource Usage**: API calls and processing time

Set up alerts for performance issues and review the analytics regularly to optimize your workflows.
