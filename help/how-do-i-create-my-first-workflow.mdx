# How do I create my first workflow?

Creating your first workflow in AetherFlow is simple and takes just a few minutes. Our AI-powered platform lets you describe what you want to automate in plain English.

## Prerequisites

Before creating your first workflow, make sure you have:

- ✅ **Active AetherFlow account** ([Sign up here](/signup))
- ✅ **At least one integration connected** (optional but recommended)
- ✅ **Clear idea of what you want to automate**

## Step-by-Step Guide

<Steps>
  <Step title="Access the dashboard">
    Log in to your AetherFlow account and navigate to the main dashboard
  </Step>
  <Step title="Click Create Workflow">
    Click the "Create Workflow" or "New Workflow" button in the top right corner
  </Step>
  <Step title="Describe your workflow">
    In the description field, write what you want to automate in plain English. Be specific and clear.

    **Example descriptions:**
    - "When I receive an email from a customer with 'urgent' in the subject, create a high-priority task in Asana and notify my team in Slack"
    - "Every morning at 9 AM, check my Google Calendar for today's meetings and send a daily briefing to my email"
    - "When a new lead is added to HubSpot with a budget over $50K, create an opportunity in Salesforce and schedule a follow-up call"
  </Step>
  <Step title="Review AI-generated steps">
    AetherFlow's AI will analyze your description and generate the workflow steps automatically. Review each step to ensure accuracy.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure integrations">
    If the workflow requires integrations you haven't connected yet, you'll be prompted to authorize them.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Test the workflow">
    Use the "Test" button to run the workflow with sample data and verify it works as expected.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Activate the workflow">
    Once tested, toggle the workflow to "Active" to start automation.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Writing Effective Descriptions

<Callout type="tip">
  **Pro Tips for Better Workflow Descriptions:**

  - **Be specific**: Include details about triggers, conditions, and actions
  - **Use clear language**: Avoid jargon or ambiguous terms
  - **Include examples**: Reference specific tools, channels, or data points
  - **Think step-by-step**: Consider the logical flow of your process
</Callout>

### Good Examples

✅ **Clear and specific:**
"When I receive an email in Gmail from john@acme.com with 'invoice' in the subject, extract the invoice amount and add it to my QuickBooks expenses"

✅ **Includes conditions:**
"If a new customer in HubSpot has 'Enterprise' as their company size and their annual revenue is over $1M, create a Salesforce opportunity and assign it to the Enterprise sales team"

### Less Effective Examples

❌ **Too vague:**
"Handle customer emails"

❌ **Missing details:**
"Send notifications when something happens"

## Common First Workflows

### Email Automation
- **Customer inquiry routing**: Sort incoming emails by topic and forward to appropriate team members
- **Invoice processing**: Extract data from invoice emails and add to accounting software
- **Meeting summaries**: Generate summaries of meeting emails and store in project management tools

### Data Synchronization
- **CRM updates**: Sync new leads from forms to your CRM system
- **Inventory alerts**: Monitor inventory levels and send alerts when stock is low
- **Report generation**: Automatically create and distribute weekly reports

### Notification Workflows
- **Social media monitoring**: Track mentions and send notifications for urgent posts
- **Error alerting**: Monitor system errors and notify the technical team
- **Deadline reminders**: Send reminders before important project deadlines

## Troubleshooting Your First Workflow

### Workflow Not Triggering
- **Check trigger conditions**: Ensure your trigger criteria are specific enough
- **Verify integrations**: Make sure connected services are properly authorized
- **Test manually**: Use the test function to simulate the trigger

### Unexpected Results
- **Review AI interpretation**: Check if the AI understood your description correctly
- **Adjust parameters**: Modify integration settings or data mapping
- **Simplify description**: Try rephrasing with clearer, more specific language

### Performance Issues
- **Check execution limits**: Monitor your plan's monthly execution allowance
- **Optimize triggers**: Use more specific conditions to reduce unnecessary runs
- **Review logs**: Check execution logs for errors or bottlenecks

## Next Steps

Once your first workflow is running successfully:

1. **Create more workflows** for other repetitive tasks
2. **Explore advanced features** like conditional logic and data transformation
3. **Monitor performance** using the analytics dashboard
4. **Connect more integrations** to expand automation possibilities
