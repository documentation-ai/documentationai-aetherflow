- **Time zone** specific execution

## API & Webhook Triggers

### Webhook Triggers
- **HTTP POST** requests to your webhook URL
- **Custom payload** processing
- **Signature verification** for security
- **Real-time event** processing

### API Triggers
- **REST API calls** to trigger workflows
- **GraphQL mutations** support
- **Authentication** via API keys or OAuth
- **Rate limiting** and abuse protection

## Manual Triggers

### Button Triggers
- **Dashboard buttons** for manual execution
- **Mobile app** triggers
- **Browser extensions** for quick actions
- **Keyboard shortcuts** support

### User-Initiated Triggers
- **Form submissions** within AetherFlow
- **Manual data entry** workflows
- **Approval workflows** requiring user input
- **Interactive workflows** with user decisions

## Advanced Trigger Features

### Conditional Triggers
- **Multiple conditions** with AND/OR logic
- **Data filtering** before workflow execution
- **Threshold triggers** (when metrics exceed limits)
- **Composite triggers** combining multiple events

### Trigger Queues & Buffering
- **Event batching** for high-volume triggers
- **Queue management** for processing delays
- **Duplicate prevention** for repeated events
- **Retry logic** for failed trigger processing

### Trigger Monitoring
- **Trigger health** dashboards
- **Event volume** tracking
- **Failure rate** monitoring
- **Performance analytics** for triggers

## Choosing the Right Trigger

### For Real-Time Automation
Use **webhook** or **API triggers** for instant processing when events occur.

### For Scheduled Tasks
Use **time-based triggers** for regular reports, maintenance, or recurring processes.

### For User-Initiated Workflows
Use **button triggers** or **manual triggers** when human decision-making is required.

### For Volume Processing
Use **conditional triggers** with batching for high-volume data processing.

## Trigger Best Practices

<Callout type="info">
  **Trigger Optimization Tips:**

  - **Be specific**: Use precise conditions to avoid unnecessary executions
  - **Test thoroughly**: Verify triggers work with real data before going live
  - **Monitor performance**: Track trigger success rates and execution volumes
  - **Use webhooks when possible**: More efficient than polling-based triggers
</Callout>

### Performance Considerations
- **Rate limiting**: Respect API limits of connected services
- **Batch processing**: Group similar events for efficiency
- **Error handling**: Plan for trigger failures and retries
- **Resource usage**: Monitor execution costs and plan limits

### Security Considerations
- **Validate sources**: Verify webhook signatures and API authentication
- **Access controls**: Limit who can trigger sensitive workflows
- **Audit logging**: Track all trigger events for compliance
- **Data validation**: Sanitize input data from external triggers
