# My workflow isn't triggering

If your AetherFlow workflow isn't starting when expected, there are several common causes and solutions to check. Follow this systematic troubleshooting guide to identify and resolve trigger issues.

## Quick Diagnosis Checklist

<Steps>
  <Step title="Check workflow status">
    Ensure the workflow is set to "Active" (not paused or disabled)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Verify trigger conditions">
    Confirm your trigger settings match the expected events
  </Step>
  <Step title="Test integrations">
    Make sure connected services are properly authorized
  </Step>
  <Step title="Check execution logs">
    Review recent activity for error messages or failures
  </Step>
  <Step title="Test manually">
    Use the manual test feature to isolate trigger issues
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Common Trigger Issues

### 1. Workflow Status Problems

**Issue:** Workflow appears active but isn't triggering

**Possible causes:**
- Workflow is in "Draft" mode
- Scheduled maintenance or system updates
- Plan limits exceeded (execution quota reached)
- Account suspension or billing issues

**Solutions:**
- Check workflow status in the dashboard
- Verify account status and billing
- Contact support if account issues persist

### 2. Trigger Configuration Errors

**Issue:** Trigger conditions don't match actual events

**Email triggers:**
- Wrong email address or domain specified
- Incorrect keyword matching (case sensitivity)
- Subject/body filters too restrictive

**Schedule triggers:**
- Time zone settings incorrect
- Business hours restrictions active
- Holiday calendar exclusions

**API/Webhook triggers:**
- Incorrect webhook URL
- Missing authentication headers
- Invalid payload format

### 3. Integration Authorization Issues

**Issue:** Connected services can't communicate with AetherFlow

**Symptoms:**
- "Authentication failed" errors
- "Access denied" messages
- Integration showing "disconnected" status

**Solutions:**
- Re-authorize the integration in Settings
- Check API permissions in the connected service
- Verify API keys or OAuth tokens are valid
- Confirm the integration supports the required scopes

### 4. Data Format Mismatches

**Issue:** Trigger data doesn't match expected format

**Common problems:**
- Date formats inconsistent
- Field names changed in source system
- Data types don't match (string vs number)
- Required fields missing or empty

**Solutions:**
- Review source system data structure
- Update field mappings in workflow settings
- Test with sample data first

### 5. Rate Limiting and Quotas

**Issue:** Trigger events exceed service limits

**External service limits:**
- API rate limits reached
- Daily/weekly quotas exceeded
- Concurrent connection limits

**AetherFlow limits:**
- Monthly execution quota reached
- Too many workflows running simultaneously
- API call limits on your plan

## Advanced Troubleshooting

### Using Execution Logs

<Steps>
  <Step title="Access workflow logs">
    Go to your workflow and click the "Logs" tab
  </Step>
  <Step title="Filter by time range">
    Focus on periods when triggers should have fired
  </Step>
  <Step title="Look for error patterns">
    Identify common failure messages or error codes
  </Step>
  <Step title="Check trigger events">
    Verify if trigger events are being received at all
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Manual Testing

<Steps>
  <Step title="Use test mode">
    Click "Test" in workflow settings
  </Step>
  <Step title="Provide sample data">
    Enter data that should trigger the workflow
  </Step>
  <Step title="Check each step">
    Verify data flows correctly through the workflow
  </Step>
  <Step title="Review results">
    Confirm expected actions occur
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Integration Health Checks

<Steps>
  <Step title="Visit integrations page">
    Go to Settings → Integrations
  </Step>
  <Step title="Check connection status">
    Look for "Connected" or "Error" indicators
  </Step>
  <Step title="Test each integration">
    Use the "Test Connection" button
  </Step>
  <Step title="Re-authorize if needed">
    Click "Reconnect" for problematic services
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Service-Specific Issues

### Email Triggers (Gmail/Outlook)
- Check spam/junk folders for test emails
- Verify email forwarding is enabled
- Confirm app passwords or OAuth permissions
- Check for email filters or rules

### Webhook Triggers
- Verify webhook URL is correct and accessible
- Check webhook signature validation
- Confirm payload format matches expectations
- Test webhook endpoint with tools like Postman

### Schedule Triggers
- Verify server time zone settings
- Check for daylight saving time issues
- Confirm business hours settings
- Review holiday calendar configurations

### API Triggers
- Validate API endpoint URLs
- Check authentication credentials
- Verify request headers and parameters
- Confirm response format expectations

## Prevention Best Practices

<Callout type="info">
  **Prevent Future Trigger Issues:**

  - **Test thoroughly**: Always test workflows before going live
  - **Monitor regularly**: Set up alerts for workflow failures
  - **Keep integrations updated**: Re-authorize services periodically
  - **Use specific conditions**: Avoid overly broad trigger criteria
  - **Document configurations**: Keep records of trigger settings
</Callout>

### Monitoring Setup
- Enable workflow performance alerts
- Set up integration health monitoring
- Create dashboards for trigger success rates
- Establish regular review processes

### Backup Plans
- Have manual alternatives for critical workflows
- Maintain documentation for quick recovery
- Test failover scenarios regularly
- Keep contact information for integration support teams
