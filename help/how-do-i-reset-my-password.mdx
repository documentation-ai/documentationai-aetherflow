## Troubleshooting Reset Issues

### Email Not Received

If you don't receive the password reset email:

- **Check spam/junk folder** - Security emails sometimes get filtered
- **Wait 5-10 minutes** - Email delivery can be delayed
- **Verify email address** - Ensure you entered the correct email
- **Check email settings** - Make sure your inbox isn't full

### Reset Link Expired

Password reset links expire after 24 hours for security:

- **Request a new reset** - Start the process again
- **Use the latest email** - Only the most recent reset link works
- **Complete quickly** - Don't leave the reset process unfinished

### Account Issues

If you're having other account access problems:

- **Multiple failed attempts** may temporarily lock your account
- **Contact support** if you can't access your email
- **Verify account status** - Check if your account is active

## Security Best Practices

  **Password Security Tips:**

  - **Use unique passwords** for each service
  - **Enable two-factor authentication** when available
  - **Change passwords regularly** (every 3-6 months)
  - **Never share passwords** with others
  - **Use a password manager** for secure storage
</Callout>

### Account Recovery

To make password recovery easier in the future:

- **Keep recovery email current** - Update if your email changes
- **Add backup email** - Set up secondary recovery options
- **Save recovery codes** - For accounts with 2FA

For enhanced security, consider enabling 2FA:

- **Available on Pro and Enterprise plans**
- **Works with authenticator apps** (Google Authenticator, Authy)

- **Hardware keys support** for maximum security

## Enterprise SSO

If your organization uses Single Sign-On:
