# Getting Started with AetherFlow

Welcome to AetherFlow! This guide will help you understand what AetherFlow is, how to get started, and answer common questions for new users.

## What is AetherFlow?

AetherFlow is an AI-powered workflow automation platform that allows you to create automations using natural language. Instead of writing complex code or using drag-and-drop interfaces, you simply describe what you want to automate in plain English, and our AI engine handles the rest.
